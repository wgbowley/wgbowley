## About Me

- Building a physics-adapter layer for multiple FEM solvers to tackle optimization in multiphysics systems
- Translating the beautiful proofs from Computational Geometry, de Berg et al., into code
- Designing a low-cost, high-speed linear motor for large- and medium-format 3D printers
- Writing a novella about a society with limited access to resources but modern theoretical knowledge
- Big fan of good stories like the movie *Arrival* and the book series *Foundation* by Isaac Asimov  
- I love sketching ideas, lucid dreaming, bouldering, and swimming
